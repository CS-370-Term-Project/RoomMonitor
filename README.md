# RoomMonitor
This is our final project for CS 370. We are using a Raspberry Pi with a ToF sensor to count how many people have entered a room. That data is send from the Pi to a PC that will display that information on our website. The data is transferred via socket connections. With the Pi as the server and the PC as the client.
